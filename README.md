# Integration between Python and ChatGPT
Just a simple example on how to use ChatGPT in our python app

In this project, we will explore how to integrate a Python program with ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, to create a simple chatbot. ChatGPT is based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, which allows it to generate coherent and context-aware responses. By integrating a Python program with ChatGPT, we can create a powerful chatbot that can understand user inputs and generate relevant responses.

By the end of this project, you will have a basic understanding of how to integrate a Python program with ChatGPT to build a simple chatbot.
